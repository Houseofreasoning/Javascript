        <h1>History of Javascript</h1>
        <p>
            Javascript, often abbreviated as JS, is a popular programming language primarily used for web development
            JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. 
            It has evolved significantly since its inception.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's a brief history of Javascript from ES1 to ES6:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>ECMAScript 1(ES1-1997):</h4></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Javascript was first introduced by Netscape Communications as LiveScript.</li>
                <li>It was later renamed Javascript when  Netscape partnered with Sun Microsystems.</li>
                <li>ES1 was the initial standardized version by ECMA international</li>
            </ul><br>

            <li><h4>ECMAScript 2(ES2-1998):</h4></li>
            <ul>
                <li>ES2 brought minor enhancements and bug fixes to the language.</li>
            </ul><br>

            <li><h4>ECMAScript 3(ES3-1999):</h4></li>
            <ul>
                <li>ES3 was a significant update, widely supported by browers for many years.</li>
                <li>It introduced features like regular expressions and exception handling.</li>
            </ul><br>

            <li><h4>ECMAScript 4(ES4-Abandoned):</h4></li>
            <ul>
                <li>ES4 was an ambitious but utimately abandoned proposal due to disagreements within the industry.</li>
            </ul><br>

            <li><h4>ECMAScript 5(ES5-2009):</h4></li>
            <ul>
                <li>ES5 brought substantial improvements and became widely adopted.</li>
                <li>It introduced strict mode, JSON support, and many other enhancements</li>
            </ul><br>

            <li><h4>ECMAScript 6(ES6,also known as ECMAScript 2015-2015):</h4></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    ES6 was a major milestone, introducing many new features like arrow fuctions, classes, template
                    literals, and more.
                </li>
                <li>It aimed to make Javascript more expressive and efficient.</li>
            </ul><br>
        </ol>

        <p>
           These Early versions laid the foundation for Javascript's widespread use in web development. After ES6, the
           ECMAScript specification transitioned to a yearly release cycle, bringing regular updates and improvements
           to the language. Subsequent versions, such as ES7(2016). ES8 (2017), and so on, introduced new features and
           enhancements to Javascript.
        </p>
        <p>
           The evolution of Javascript continues, with ESNext(also known as ESNext or ESNext+1) referring to the next
           upcoming version, which includes proposals and features that are being developed and considered for inclusion
           in the language. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Javascript has become a versatile and powerful language, not only for web development but also for server-side 
            development(Node.js), mobile app development(React Native), and more, making it a crucial part of modern software
            development.

       <h2>Differences between Java and JavaScript</h2>
       <p>
         Java and JavaScript are two distinct programming languages that share a similar name but have different
         purposes, syntax, and use cases. Here's a brief different between Java and JavaScript:
       </p>
       <ol>
         <li><b>Purpose:</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Java: Java is a general-purpose, high-level programming language used for developing a wide range of
                    applications, including desktop software, web applications,mobile apps(Andriod), and server-side
                    applications 
                </li>

                <li>
                    JavaScript: JavaScript is primarily a scripting language used for front-end web development.
                    it's executed in web browsers and is mainly used for creating interactive and dynamic web pages.
                </li>
            </ul>


           <li><b>Platform:</b></li>
           <ul>
               <li>
                   Java: Java is platform-independent and can be run on various platforms using the Java Virtual machine
                   (JVM).
               </li>

               <li>
                   JavaScript: JavaScript is primarily used in web browsers and runs within the brower's JavaScript
                   engine.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Java: Java has a C-style syntax and uses a statically-typed system where variable types
                    must be declared before use.
                </li>

                <li>
                    JavaScript: JavaScript has a C-style syntax similar to java, but it uses a dynamically-typed system
                    where variable types are determined at runtime.
                </li>
            </ul>
    

    
            <li><b>Typing:</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Java: Java has a statically-typed language, which means variable types are explicitly declared and
                    checked at compile-time.
                </li>

                <li>
                    JavaScript: JavaScript is dynamically-typed,allowing variables to change types during runtime
                    without explicit type declaration.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <li><b>Usage:</b></li>
            <ul>

       <h2>10 reserved keywords in JavaScript  and what they do</h2>
       <p>
        JavaScript has several reserved keywords that have special meanings within the language.<br>
        Here are 10 commonly used reserved keywords in JavaScript and a brief description of what they do:
       </p>
       <ol>
         <li><b>var:</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>Used to declare variables in JavaScript.Variable declared with <b>'var'</b> are function-scoped</li>
          </ul>

          <li><b>let:</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>
                Introduced in ES6, <b>'let'</b> is used to declare block-scoped variables. It allows for better
                scoping control than <b>'var'</b>.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <li><b>const:</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>
                Also introduced in ES6,'const' is used to declare constants. variables declared with 'const'
                cannot be reassigned after they are initialized.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <li><b>function:</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>
                Used to declare a function. Functions are blocks of reusable code that can 
                be invoked with or without parameter
            </li>
          </ul>

          <li><b>If:</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>
                Used to conditionally execute code  based on a specified condition. It's part of control flow statements.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <li><b>else:</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>
                Used in conjuction with <b>'if'</b> to specify code that should execute when the condition
                in the <b>'if' statement is false.</b>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <li><b>for:</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>
                Used to create loops. The <b>'for'</b> statement includes initialization, condition, and  iteration
                expressions to control the loop's behaviour.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <li><b>while:</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>
                Another loop statement used to repeatedly exeute a block of code as long as a specified condition
                is true.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <li><b>switch:</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>
                Used for conditional branching. It allows you to execute different blocks of code based on the value
                of an expression.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <li><b>return:</b></li>
          <ul>
            <li>
                Used within functions to specify the value to be returned  from the function. It also terminates
                the fuction's execution.
            </li>
          </ul>
       </ol>
       <p>
         These keywords are fundamental to JavaScript and are used in various combinations to create complex programs.
         Understanding how they work is crucial for writing effective JavaScript code.

                <li>
                    Both <b>'let'</b> and <b>'const'</b> are block-scoped, which means they are limited to the

                    All three can be reassigned. You can change the value of a variable declared 
                    with <b>'var'</b>, <b>'let'</b>, or <b>'const'</b>.

                <li>
                    All three are hoisted to the top of their containing function or block.This means you can use a
                    variable before it's declared, but it will have an initial value of <b>'undefined'</b>. 
                </li>

                <li>
                    Both <b>'let'</b> and <b>'const'</b> have a temporal dead zone, which means you can't access
                    them before they are declared in the current-block.  
                </li>
            </ul>

            <li><b>Initialization:</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>'var'</b> and <b>'let'</b> can be declared without initializing them with a value. They will
                    have an initial value of <b>'undefined'</b>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>'const'</b> must be initialized with a value when declared. It cannot be declared without
                    an initial value  
                </li>
            </ul>

            <li><b>Redefinition:</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>'var'</b> and <b>'let'</b> allow you to declare variables with the same name multiple times
                    within the same scope, effectively redefining them,
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>'const'</b> does not allow redeclaration of the same variable name within the same scope
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In summary, <b>'let'</b> and <b>'const'</b> are recommended over <b>'var'</b> for modern JavaScript
            development due to their block-scoping and the prevention of certain common programmin errors, <b>'const'</b>
            should be used when the variable's value should not change after initialization, while <b>'let'</b> should
            be used when variable reassignment are needed.
